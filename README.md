# tetris
tetris clone with custom AI.\
built in rust using my game engine Untitled_Engine.\
\
i havent updated the UI yet, but hit P to activate the AI. its still in training but should do pretty well. --auto-loop to let the ai restart games on its own.\
if youre interested in training your own AI, pass the arg --train. look in train.rs for the parameters to change how the evolutionary alg works.
